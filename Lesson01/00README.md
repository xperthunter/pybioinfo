## Learning Objectives ##

* Unix - basic commands and directory structure

At the end of the lesson, you will have your own GitHub repository with
your first Python program: `hello_world.py`. Along the way you will have
learned some of the most useful Unix commands, be able to navigate the
Unix directory structure, and save typing with tab-completion. You will
