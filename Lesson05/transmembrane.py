# Write a program that predicts if a protein is trans-membrane
# Trans-membrane proteins have the following properties
#	Signal peptide: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_peptide
#	Hydrophobic regions(s): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmembrane_protein
#	No prolines (alpha helix)
# Hydrophobicity is measued via Kyte-Dolittle
#	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophilicity_plot
# For our purposes:
#	Signal peptide is 8 aa long, KD > 2.5, first 30 aa
#	Hydrophobic region is 11 aa long, KD > 2.0, after 30 aa
