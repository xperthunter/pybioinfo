# You are probably well aware of the 'birthday paradox'
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem
# Let's try simulating it
# We will have a variable number of bins (can be months or days)
# And some number of trials for the simulation
# And some number of people whose have random birthdays
# Use assert() to check parameters
# On the command line:
#	python3 birthday.py <bins> <trials> <people>
