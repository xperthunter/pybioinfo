Lesson 3
========

## Learning Objectives ##

* Conditional Execution - Boolean type, if, elif, else, while, break, continue
* String Formatting - various ways or printing

## Tutorials ##

Start by following `05_conditionals.py`. Here, you will learn of the
*Boolean* type, which is used to represent `True` and `False`. The
Boolean operators include `and`, `or`, and `not`. You are also
introduced to the `while` loop, which is less common than a `for` loop,
but is useful because it has its own conditional expression in the loop.

In `05_conditionals.py`, you will also learn how to control loops using
the `break` and `continue` statements. These let you leave a loop early,
or skip ahead to the next iteration.

Next, follow `06_string_formatting.py`. There are several ways of
creating nicely formatted output. The syntaxes can be somewhat
confusing. You need to be aware of the multiple formatting options so
that you're not confused when you see other peoples' programs, but in
your own code, you can use the method that makes the most sense to you.

## Coding Exercises ##

For programming practice, try writing the following programs. The
instructions are inside each file.

Copy these to your `learning_python` directory.
Don't program in the `MCB185` directory !

1. `at_seq.py`
2. `anti.py`
3. `gc.py`
4. `fizzbuzz.py`
5. `gc_win.py`
6. `gc_win2.py`
7. `gc_win3.py`
8. `gc_win4.py`
